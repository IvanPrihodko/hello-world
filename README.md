A repository is usually used to organize a single project.

Projects is when you and your friends go to an all you can eat sushi buffet and you're trying to figure out how to finish everything without paying extra. Usually there are several ways to reach this goal. One is have someone sacrifice themselves for the greater good. Another is when you put extra food in the purse, toilet, or pockets. Anything works, but looking at someone suffer is always entertaining.
